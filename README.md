Kuvia vuosien varrelta K-junan reitin varrelta


A photo gallery of pictures of FINNA system showing different parts of Helsinki starting from the first stop of K-train on Helsinki Centrum and moving on to Malmi. Contains multiple html pages.

There is a bug with starting the slideshow when exploring the different pages of the website. To make it start the user has to click the first exploration button.

The slideshow functionality is made with javascript. The photos are within the websites folder, because unfortunately I couldn't make the API work the way I intended.

In continuation I plan to make the website work with the FINNA API once I learn more.
